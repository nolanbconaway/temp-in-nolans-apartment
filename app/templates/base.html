  <h2>What is this?</h2>

  <p>
    In NYC, building owners are required to provide heat to tenants. Per
    <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01036">this page</a
    >, the requirements are:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Heat must be provided between October 1st and May 31st, i.e. "Heat
      Season," under the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Between the hours of 6:00am and 10:00pm, if the outside temperature
        falls below 55 degrees, the inside temperature is required to be at
        least 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Between the hours of 10:00pm and 6:00am, the inside temperature is
        required to be at least 62 degrees Fahrenheit.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I set up a raspberry pi with a thermometer so that I can check on whether my
    apartment is warm enough. The temperature is recorded once per minute in a
    cron job, using my
    <a href="https://github.com/nolanbconaway/thermometer"
      >thermometer python library</a
    >. This move is partially inspired by
    <a href="https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/room_temperatures"
      >John's room temperature dataset</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2>More Info</h2>

  <h3>Where is the sensor?</h3>
  <p>
    I taped down the raspberry pi to the inside of cardboard box and put the box
    under the couch in the living room. The living room is the warmest room in
    the house. The couch is a bit closer to the window than the radiator.
  </p>

  <h3>How did you build it?</h3>
  <p>
    I followed a few guides.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Some of "<a
        href="https://www.hackster.io/timfernando/a-raspberry-pi-thermometer-you-can-access-anywhere-33061c"
        >A Raspberry Pi Thermometer you can Access Anywhere</a
      >".
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of "<a
        href="https://opensource.com/article/17/10/set-postgres-database-your-raspberry-pi"
        >How to set up a Postgres database on a Raspberry Pi</a
      >".
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But I made some departures from each guide that i did not specifically keep
    track of. In particular I found the circuit in the thermometer guide did not
    work and so I used
    <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor/">
      this one</a
    >
    instead.
