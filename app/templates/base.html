      <h2>What is this?</h2>

      <p>
        Last winter, I felt like apartment was very cold. I looked up
        temperature requirements in NYC and found
        <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1815/residential-heat-and-hot-water-requirements">this page</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The period between October 1 and May 31 is Heat Season. During this
          time, the City requires building owners to provide tenants with heat
          according to the following rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Between 6 AM and 10 PM, if the outside temperature falls below 55
            degrees, the inside temperature must be at least 68 degrees
            Fahrenheit.
          </li>
          <li>Between 10 PM and 6 AM, the inside temperature must be at least
            62 degrees Fahrenheit at all times. There is no outside temperature
            requirement.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I didn't collect any data to back this up, but I felt like it was
        <i>often</i> cooler than 68&deg; in my apartment (though it was probably
        rarely cooler than 62&deg;).
      </p>

      <p>
        This year I will not make that mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
         I want some hard data to bring to my building's management so that
         they might <i>turn up the heat</i>.

        So I hooked up a Raspberry Pi with a temperature sensor to record the
        temperature every minute. This move is partially inspired by
        <a href="https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/room_temperatures">John's
        room temperature dataset</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Update (as of mid-December)</h3>

      <p>
        Independently of my efforts, a <i>petition</i> has been circulated
        within the building in order to increase the temperature. Since then,
        my thermometer has been reading at a comfy 70&deg;-72&deg;.
      </p>

      <p>
         Before then, the temperature usually only fell below 68&deg; for an
         hour or so at about 6AM. Maybe last winter it was colder? Maybe I am
         just being a crazy person? I'll leave that up to you.
      </p>

      <h2>More Info</h2>

        <h3>Where is the sensor?</h3>
          <p>
            It's on a shelf in the living room. Closer to the the radiator than
            to the window. The wiring is loose and exposed, so I might throw it
            in a cardboard box and put it somewhere more out-of-the-way.
          </p>

        <h3>How did you build it?</h3>
        <p>
          I followed a few guides.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Some of "<a href="https://www.hackster.io/timfernando/a-raspberry-pi-thermometer-you-can-access-anywhere-33061c">A Raspberry Pi Thermometer you can Access Anywhere</a>".
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of "<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/10/set-postgres-database-your-raspberry-pi">How to set up a Postgres database on a Raspberry Pi</a>".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          But I made some departures from each guide that i did not specifically
          keep track of.

          In particular I found the circuit in the thermometer guide did not work
          and so I used <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor/">
          this one</a> instead.
